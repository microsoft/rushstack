# Analyze and Explain Code Functionality

## Available Tools

The following MCP tools are available and SHOULD be used when relevant:

- **DeepWiki** (`ask_question`): Use to look up documentation for external libraries, frameworks, and GitHub repositories. Particularly useful for understanding third-party dependencies and their APIs.
- **WebFetch/WebSearch**: Use to retrieve web content for additional context if information is not found in DeepWiki.

## Instructions

Follow this systematic approach to explain code: **$ARGUMENTS**

1. **Code Context Analysis**
   - Identify the programming language and framework
   - Understand the broader context and purpose of the code
   - Identify the file location and its role in the project

2. **High-Level Overview**
   - Provide a summary of what the code does
   - Explain the main purpose and functionality
   - Identify the problem the code is solving
   - Describe how it fits into the larger system

3. **Code Structure Breakdown**
   - Break down the code into logical sections

   - Explain object relationships and hierarchies
   - Clarify input and output formats

7. **Framework and Library Usage**
   - Explain framework-specific patterns and conventions
   - Describe library functions and their purposes
   - Explain API calls and their expected responses
   - Clarify configuration and setup code
   - Use the DeepWiki MCP tool (`deepwiki_ask_question`) to look up documentation for external libraries when needed

8. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
   - Explain error handling mechanisms
   - Describe exception handling and recovery
   - Identify edge cases being handled
   - Explain validation and defensive programming

9. **Performance Considerations**
   - Identify performance-critical sections
   - Explain optimization techniques being used
   - Describe complexity and scalability implications
   - Point out potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies

10. **Security Implications**
    - Identify security-related code sections
    - Explain authentication and authorization logic
    - Describe input validation and sanitization
    - Point out potential security vulnerabilities

11. **Testing and Debugging**
    - Explain how the code can be tested
    - Identify debugging points and logging
    - Describe mock data or test scenarios
    - Explain test helpers and utilities

12. **Dependencies and Integrations**
    - Explain external service integrations
    - Describe database operations and queries
    - Explain API interactions and protocols
    - Clarify third-party library usage

**Explanation Format Examples:**

**For Complex Algorithms:**
```
This function implements a depth-first search algorithm:

1. Line 1-3: Initialize a stack with the starting node and a visited set
2. Line 4-8: Main loop - continue until stack is empty
3. Line 9-11: Pop a node and check if it's the target
4. Line 12-15: Add unvisited neighbors to the stack
5. Line 16: Return null if target not found

Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is vertices and E is edges
Space Complexity: O(V) for the visited set and stack
```

**For API Integration Code:**
```
This code handles user authentication with a third-party service:

1. Extract credentials from request headers
2. Validate credential format and required fields
3. Make API call to authentication service
4. Handle response and extract user data
5. Create session token and set cookies
6. Return user profile or error response

Error Handling: Catches network errors, invalid credentials, and service unavailability
Security: Uses HTTPS, validates inputs, and sanitizes responses
```

**For Database Operations:**
```
This function performs a complex database query with joins:

1. Build base query with primary table
2. Add LEFT JOIN for related user data
3. Apply WHERE conditions for filtering
4. Add ORDER BY for consistent sorting
5. Implement pagination with LIMIT/OFFSET
6. Execute query and handle potential errors
7. Transform raw results into domain objects

Performance Notes: Uses indexes on filtered columns, implements connection pooling
```

13. **Common Patterns and Idioms**
    - Identify language-specific patterns and idioms
    - Explain design patterns being implemented
    - Describe architectural patterns in use
    - Clarify naming conventions and code style

14. **Potential Improvements**
    - Suggest code improvements and optimizations
    - Identify possible refactoring opportunities
    - Point out maintainability concerns
    - Recommend best practices and standards

15. **Related Code and Context**
    - Reference related functions and classes
    - Explain how this code interacts with other components
    - Describe the calling context and usage patterns
    - Point to relevant documentation and resources
