# TLS Sync VS Code Extension (Local / UI Extension)

This extension is designed to work with the [TLS Sync VS Code Workspace extension](../tls-sync-vscode-workspace-extension), providing a seamless experience for managing TLS certificates in a remote development environment.

The UI extension manages the certificates on the local machine and provides an API for the Workspace extension to synchronize certificates with the remote workspace.

See [TLS Sync VS Code Workspace extension](../tls-sync-vscode-workspace-extension) for more details on the TLS Sync extensions.
