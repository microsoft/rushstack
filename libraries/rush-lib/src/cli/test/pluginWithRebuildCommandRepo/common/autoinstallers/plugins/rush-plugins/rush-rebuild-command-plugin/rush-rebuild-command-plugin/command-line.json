// If no command-line.json file defines "rush build" and "rush rebuild", then normally Rush's default
// definitions are applied as if they were defined in common/config/rush/command-line.json,

// customizes "rush rebuild" in this plugin, then the defaults are applied here, and as a result the
// corresponding phases must also be defined by this plugin.
