Rush will automatically invoke the package manager to install these dependencies before an associated command is invoked.  Autoinstallers have the advantage that they work even in a branch where \"rush install\" is broken, which makes them a good solution for Git hook scripts.  But they have the disadvantages of not being buildable projects, and of increasing the overall installation footprint for your monorepo.\n\nThe \"autoinstallerName\" setting must not contain a path and must be a valid NPM package name.\n\nFor example, the name \"my-task\" would map to \"common/autoinstallers/my-task/package.json\", and the \"common/autoinstallers/my-task/node_modules/.bin\" folder would be added to the shell PATH when invoking the \"shellCommand\".",
