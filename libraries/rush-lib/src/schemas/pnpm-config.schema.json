This generally works well, but in certain cases such as differing `peerDependencies` versions, symlinking may cause trouble such as incorrectly satisfied versions.  For such cases, the dependency can be declared as \"injected\", causing PNPM to copy its built output into `node_modules` like a real install from a registry.  Details here: https://rushjs.io/pages/advanced/injected_deps/\n\nWhen using Rush subspaces, these sorts of versioning problems are much more likely if `workspace:` refers to a project from a different subspace.  This is because the symlink would point to a separate `node_modules` tree installed by a different PNPM lockfile.  A comprehensive solution is to enable `alwaysInjectDependenciesFromOtherSubspaces`, which automatically treats all projects from other subspaces as injected dependencies without having to manually configure them.\n\nNOTE: Use carefully -- excessive file copying can slow down the `rush install` and `pnpm-sync` operations if too many dependencies become injected.\n\nThe default value is false.",
