      "description": "(UNDER DEVELOPMENT) For certain installation problems involving peer dependencies, PNPM cannot correctly satisfy versioning requirements without installing duplicate copies of a package inside the node_modules folder. This poses a problem for 'workspace:*' dependencies, as they are normally installed by making a symlink to the local project source folder. PNPM's 'injected dependencies' feature provides a model for copying the local project folder into node_modules, however copying must occur AFTER the dependency project is built and BEFORE the consuming project starts to build. The 'pnpm-sync' tool manages this operation; see its documentation for details. Enable this experiment if you want 'rush' and 'rushx' commands to resync injected dependencies by invoking 'pnpm-sync' during the build.",

      "description": "(UNDER DEVELOPMENT) The Rush alerts feature provides a way to send announcements to engineers working in the monorepo, by printing directly in the user's shell window when they invoke Rush commands. This ensures that important notices will be seen by anyone doing active development, since people often ignore normal discussion group messages or don't know to subscribe.",

      "description": "Rush has a policy that normally requires Rush projects to specify `workspace:*` in package.json when depending on other projects in the workspace, unless they are explicitly declared as `decoupledLocalDependencies` in rush.json. Enabling this experiment will remove that requirement for dependencies belonging to a different subspace.
