This poses a problem for 'workspace:*' dependencies, as they are normally installed by making a symlink to the local project source folder. PNPM's 'injected dependencies' feature provides a model for copying the local project folder into node_modules, however copying must occur AFTER the dependency project is built and BEFORE the consuming project starts to build. The 'pnpm-sync' tool manages this operation; see its documentation for details. Enable this experiment if you want 'rush' and 'rushx' commands to resync injected dependencies by invoking 'pnpm-sync' during the build.",
