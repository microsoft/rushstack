   * releases are `1.8.9` and `2.3.4`.  The resolution mode `lowest-direct` might choose
   * `lib-y@1.2.3`, wheres `highest` will choose 1.8.9, and `time-based` will pick the

   * they are explicitly requested. Although `time-based` is the most robust option, it may be
   * slightly slower with registries such as npmjs.com that have not implemented an optimization.
   *
   * IMPORTANT: Be aware that PNPM 8.0.0 initially defaulted to `lowest-direct` instead of
   * `highest`, but PNPM reverted this decision in 8.6.12 because it caused confusion for users.
   * Rush version 5.106.0 and newer avoids this confusion by consistently defaulting to
   * `highest` when `resolutionMode` is not explicitly set in pnpm-config.json or .npmrc,
   * regardless of your PNPM version.
