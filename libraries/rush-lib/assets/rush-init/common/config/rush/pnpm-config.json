   * This setting determines how PNPM chooses version numbers during `rush update`.
   * For example, suppose `lib-x@3.0.0` depends on `"lib-y": "^1.2.3"` whose latest major
   * releases are `1.8.9` and `2.3.4`.  The resolution mode `lowest-direct` might choose
   * `lib-y@1.2.3`, wheres `highest` will choose 1.8.9, and `time-based` will pick the
   * highest compatible version at the time when `lib-x@3.0.0` itself was published (ensuring
   * that the version could have been tested by the maintainer of "lib-x").  For local workspace
   * projects, `time-based` instead works like `lowest-direct`, avoiding upgrades unless
   * they are explicitly requested. Although `time-based` is the most robust option, it may be
   * slightly slower with registries such as npmjs.com that have not implemented an optimization.
   *
   * IMPORTANT: Be aware that PNPM 8.0.0 initially defaulted to `lowest-direct` instead of
   * `highest`, but PNPM reverted this decision in 8.6.12 because it caused confusion for users.
   * Rush version 5.106.0 and newer avoids this confusion by consistently defaulting to
   * `highest` when `resolutionMode` is not explicitly set in pnpm-config.json or .npmrc,
   * regardless of your PNPM version.
   *
   * PNPM documentation: https://pnpm.io/npmrc#resolution-mode

   * is inherently complicated, and it is easier to troubleshoot consequences of an explicit
   * version than an invisible heuristic.  The original NPM RFC discussion pointed out
   * some other problems with this feature: https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/43
