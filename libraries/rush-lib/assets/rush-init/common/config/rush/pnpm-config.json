   * generate a "pnpm-workspace.yaml" file referencing all local projects to install. Rush will
   * also generate a "pnpmfile.js" which is used to provide preferred versions support. When install
   * is run, this pnpmfile will be used to replace dependency version ranges with a smaller subset
   * of the original range. If the preferred version is not fully a subset of the original version
   * range, it will be left as-is. After this, the pnpmfile.js provided in the repository (if one
   * exists) will be called to further modify package dependencies.

   * option for PNPM.  Possible values are "fast" and "fewer-dependencies".  PNPM's default is "fast", but this may
   * be incompatible with certain packages, for example the "@types" packages from DefinitelyTyped.  Rush's default
   * is "fewer-dependencies", which causes PNPM to avoid installing a newer version if an already installed version
   * can be reused; this is more similar to NPM's algorithm.

   * if the PNPM shrinkwrap file ("pnpm-lock.yaml") is manually edited.  When this
   * feature is enabled, "rush update" will append a hash to the file as a YAML comment,
   * and then "rush update" and "rush install" will validate the hash.  Note that this does not prohibit
   * manual modifications, but merely requires "rush update" be run
   * afterwards, ensuring that PNPM can report or repair any potential inconsistencies.
