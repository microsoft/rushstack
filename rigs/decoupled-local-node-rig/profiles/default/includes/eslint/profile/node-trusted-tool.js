// This profile disables certain security rules that would otherwise prohibit APIs that could
// cause a denial-of-service by consuming too many resources, or which might interact with
// the filesystem in unsafe ways.  Such activities are safe and commonplace for a trusted tool.

// DO NOT use this profile for a library project that might also be loaded by a Node.js service;
