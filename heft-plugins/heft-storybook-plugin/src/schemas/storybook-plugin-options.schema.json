    "storykitPackageName": {
      "title": "Specifies an NPM package that will provide the Storybook dependencies for the project.",
      "description": "Storybook's conventional approach is for your app project to have direct dependencies on NPM packages such as `@storybook/react` and `@storybook/addon-essentials`.  These packages have heavyweight dependencies such as Babel, Webpack, and the associated loaders and plugins needed to build the Storybook app (which is bundled completely independently from Heft).  Naively adding these dependencies to your app's package.json muddies the waters of two radically different toolchains, and is likely to lead to dependency conflicts, for example if Heft installs Webpack 5 but `@storybook/react` installs Webpack 4. To solve this problem, `heft-storybook-plugin` introduces the concept of a separate \"storykit package\".  All of your Storybook NPM packages are moved to be dependencies of the storykit.  Storybook's browser API unfortunately isn't separated into dedicated NPM packages, but instead is exported by the Node.js toolchain packages such as `@storybook/react`.  For an even cleaner separation the storykit package can simply reexport such APIs.",

      "description": "By default the plugin executes the storybook commands in the local package context, but for distribution purposes it can be useful to split the TS library and storybook exports into two packages. For example, If you create a storybook 'app' project \"my-ui-storybook-library-app\" for the storybook preview distribution, and your main UI component `library` is my-ui-storybook-library. Your 'app' project is able to compile the 'library' storybook app using the CWD target: `\"cwdPackageName\": \"my-ui-storybook-library\"`",
