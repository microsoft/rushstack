# Change Log - @microsoft/rush

This log was last generated on Mon, 06 Jan 2025 21:48:43 GMT and should not be manually modified.

## 5.147.2
Mon, 06 Jan 2025 21:48:43 GMT

### Updates

- Fix an issue with evaluation of `shouldEnsureConsistentVersions` when the value is not constant across subspaces or variants.
- Fix an issue where the lockfile object has a nullish value causing yaml.dump to report an error.

## 5.147.1
Thu, 26 Dec 2024 23:35:27 GMT

### Updates

- Fix an issue with the `enableSubpathScan` experiment where the set of returned hashes would result in incorrect build cache identifiers when using `--only`.
- When a no-op operation is not in scope, reflect its result as no-op instead of skipped, so that downstream operations can still write to the build cache.
- Allow injected dependencies without enabling subspaces.

## 5.147.0
Thu, 12 Dec 2024 01:37:25 GMT

### Updates

- Add a new experiment flag `enableSubpathScan` that, when invoking phased script commands with project selection parameters, such as `--to` or `--from`, only hashes files that are needed to compute the cache ids for the selected projects.

## 5.146.0
Tue, 10 Dec 2024 21:23:18 GMT

### Updates

- Support fallback syntax in `.npmrc` files if the package manager is PNPM. See https://pnpm.io/npmrc

- Support pnpm lockfile v9, which is used by default starting in pnpm v9.

## 5.145.0
Tue, 10 Dec 2024 05:14:11 GMT

Mon, 02 Dec 2024 20:40:41 GMT

### Updates

- Fix an issue where Rush sometimes incorrectly reported "fatal: could not open 'packages/xxx/.rush/temp/shrinkwrap-deps.json' for reading: No such file or directory" when using subspaces

## 5.141.0
Tue, 19 Nov 2024 06:38:33 GMT

### Updates

- Adds two new properties to the configuration for `rush-azure-storage-build-cache-plugin`: `loginFlow` selects the flow to use for interactive authentication to Entra ID, and `readRequiresAuthentication` specifies that a SAS token is required for read and therefore expired authentication is always fatal.
- Adds a new `wasExecutedOnThisMachine` property to operation telemetry events, to simplify reporting about cobuilt operations.
- Fix an issue where empty error logs were created for operations that did not write to standard error.
- Fix an issue where incremental building (with LegacySkipPlugin) would not work when no-op operations were present in the process
- Fix lack of "local-only" option for cacheProvider in build-cache.schema.json
- Fix an issue where if an Operation wrote all logs to stdout, then exited with a non-zero exit code, only the non-zero exit code would show up in the summary.

## 5.140.1
Wed, 30 Oct 2024 21:50:51 GMT

### Updates

- Update the `jsonpath-plus` indirect dependency to mitigate CVE-2024-21534.

## 5.140.0
Tue, 22 Oct 2024 23:59:54 GMT

### Updates

- Fix an issue when using `rush deploy` where the `node_modules/.bin` folder symlinks were not created for deployed packages when using the "default" link creation mode
- Add support for the `globalIgnoredOptionalDependencies` field in the `common/config/rush/pnpm-config.json` file to allow specifying optional dependencies that should be ignored by PNPM

## 5.139.0
Thu, 17 Oct 2024 20:37:39 GMT

### Updates

- Allow rush plugins to extend build cache entries by writing additional files to the metadata folder. Expose the metadata folder path to plugins.
- [CACHE BREAK] Alter the computation of build cache IDs to depend on the graph of operations in the build and therefore account for multiple phases, rather than only the declared dependencies. Ensure that `dependsOnEnvVars` and command line parameters that affect upstream phases impact the cache IDs of downstream operations.
- (BREAKING CHANGE) Replace use of `ProjectChangeAnalyzer` in phased command hooks with a new `InputsSnapshot` data structure that is completely synchronous and does not perform any disk operations. Perform all disk operations and state computation prior to executing the build graph.
- Add a new property `enabled` to `Operation` that when set to false, will cause the execution engine to immediately return `OperationStatus.Skipped` instead of invoking the runner. Use this property to disable operations that are not intended to be executed in the current pass, e.g. those that did not contain changes in the most recent watch iteration, or those excluded by `--only`.
- Add an optional property `cacheHashSalt` to `build-cache.json` to allow repository maintainers to globally force a hash change in build cache entries.

## 5.138.0
Thu, 03 Oct 2024 22:31:07 GMT

### Updates

- Changes the behavior of phased commands in watch mode to, when running a phase `_phase:<name>` in all iterations after the first, prefer a script entry named `_phase:<name>:incremental` if such a script exists. The build cache will expect the outputs from the corresponding `_phase:<name>` script (with otherwise the same inputs) to be equivalent when looking for a cache hit.

## 5.137.0
Thu, 03 Oct 2024 19:46:40 GMT

### Patches

- Expose `getChangesByProject` to allow classes that extend ProjectChangeAnalyzer to override file change analysis

## 5.136.1
Thu, 26 Sep 2024 22:59:11 GMT

### Updates

## 5.136.0
Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:48:00 GMT

### Updates

- Bring back the Variants feature that was removed in https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/pull/4538.
- Bump express dependency to 4.20.0

## 5.135.0

- Make individual Rush log files available via the rush-serve-plugin server at the relative URL specified by "logServePath" option. Annotate operations sent over the WebSocket with the URLs of their log files.
- Adds a new experiment 'allowCobuildWithoutCache' for cobuilds to allow uncacheable operations to benefit from cobuild orchestration without using the build cache.
- Deprecate the `sharding.shardOperationSettings` property in the project `config/rush-project.json` in favor of an `operationSettings` entry for an operation with a suffix of `:shard`.

## 5.62.2
Thu, 10 Feb 2022 03:21:41 GMT

### Updates

- Add the ability to forcibly replace bad cache entries generated by issues in a previous Rush release.
- Fix an issue where the dependencies of lockstep-versioned projects aren't bumped when the lockstep-versioned projects' versions are bumped. This issue only arose in the scenario when the lockstep-versioned projects' version bumps are driven by the change type in the changefiles and not by the "nextBump" property in "common/config/rush/version-policies.json"
- Fix an issue where "rush setup" reported a TypeError when invoked from Git Bash

- Fix an issue where Git Bash "tar" does not handle Windows paths correctly.
- (EXPERIMENTAL) Improve the RUSH_BUILD_CACHE_WRITE_ALLOWED environment variable behavior so that it also affects the local build cache. This saves CPU cycles on CI machines that only run a single build. It also avoids cache writes for watch mode commands.
- Refactoring to support upcoming watch mode improvements: Rework the task execution engine to interact with the task queue using the ECMAScript async iteration protocol (GitHub #3043)
- Fix project change detection when a new project is added to a repo that uses PNPM with useWorkspaces=false (GitHub #3183)

- Fixes a regression in bulk command execution when using "unsafe" selector parameters, e.g. "--only". Ensures that only the projects selected by the parameters get included in the build, rather that forcibly including all dependencies.

## 5.59.0
Thu, 06 Jan 2022 22:18:13 GMT

### Minor changes

- Update the "rush init" template to enable pnpm workspaces and to merge the pnpm-lock.yaml file as text.

- Fix an issue with installing Git hooks that occurs when the rush.json folder isn't at the repo's root.
- (BREAKING CHANGE) Remove the experimental command "rush write-build-cache", since it is no longer needed and would be incompatible with phased builds. If you need this command for some reason, please create a GitHub issue.
- Add support for phased commands behind the multiPhaseCommands experiment.
- Update "rush init" to write files with OS-default line endings (CRLF on Windows, LF otherwise) instead of always writing CRLF line endings.

- (EXPERIMENTAL) Ability to load third-party plugin packages that customize the behavior of Rush
- Fix an issue where parameter values containing spaces are incorrectly passed to global scripts.
- Parameters such as "--to" and "--from" now accept selector expressions: "version-policy:NAME" indicates the set of projects belonging to a publishing version policy. "git:REF" detects the set of projects that have been modified since the specified Git revision; for example, this allows a Rush command to process only the projects modified by a PR branch. (GitHub #2968)
- Improved the change detection logic to work correctly when a second rush.json appears in a subfolder.
- (EXPERIMENTAL) Add a new NPM package "@rushstack/rush-sdk" for use by Rush plugins
- Stop deleting the pnpm-store after failed workspace installs. Usually a multiple failure is due to a network error or a package that does not exist in the registry, not an issue with the pnpm-store.

## 5.30.0
Fri, 17 Jul 2020 05:32:38 GMT

### Minor changes

- Prepare to deprecate 'rush link' and 'rush unlink' commands, as well as the '--no-link' install argument. As we move toward using package managers more directly in Rush, the package managers will perform the linking during install (if linking is even necessary). Additionally, these commands directly conflict with (and have different meanings than) their package manager counterparts. Lastly, similar goals can be accomplished by running 'rush install' and 'rush purge'. In addition to these changes, rush-link.json deprecated and is replaced with a new API which keeps the local dependency tree in memory.

Tue, 16 Jul 2019 19:36:08 GMT

### Updates

- Rush now warns when phantom node_modules folders are found
- Relax the rush.json version check for rush-lib; future versions are now accepted as long as the major/minor parts match

## 4.3.0
Fri, 02 Mar 2018 02:45:37 GMT

### Updates

- Fix an issue where we always deleted the pnpm store. This is not necessary since the store is transactional. We should only delete the store if it is a --clean install.
- Fix an issue where the package manager installation could get corrupted if the Rush tool was accidentally invoked multiple times concurrently.
- Fix issue with pnpm where store was not removed after an unsuccessful installation
- When Rush links PNPM packages to their dependencies, it should link to the realpath, rather than linking to the symlink. This will improve performance of builds by reducing the number of file system reads that are needed.
- Update Rush to consider the shrinkwrap file during incremental builds.
- Add a --changed-projects-only flag to 'rush build', which will skip rebuilding of downstream packages. It will only rebuild projects that change, but not their dependents.
- Add a locking mechanism around certain rush commands so only one process can be working in a Rush repository at a single point in time. This is useful for commands that may corrupt each other, like generate, install, link, and rebuild.
- When using pnpm, Rush will check and see if other projects are using a dependency and will re-use it if possible. This way, a user will not have to run "rush generate" if they are adding a dependency that is already being used elsewhere in the monorepo.
- Add a notice for unsupported versions of NodeJS runtime
- Add a new command-line flag "--conservative" which causes "rush generate" to perform a minimal upgrade
- Improved "rush generate" so that if interrupted, it does not leave you with a deleted shrinkwrap.yaml; the new integrity checks eliminate the need for this, and it was annoying
- Fix Rush version increase logic to handle cyclic dependencies properly

## 2.2.0
Fri, 24 Feb 2017 22:44:31 GMT

### Minor changes
