NOTE: We do not invoke ESLint on this project's source files, because ESLint's module resolution (as of 6.x) is naive
and fairly brittle.  It gets confused between the dependencies of this project, versus the dependencies of
@rushstack/eslint-config (which imports the previously published version of this project).  Normally we solve
this problem by using Rush's "decoupledLocalDependencies" feature, but that fails because ESLint does not correctly
implement NodeJS module resolution.
