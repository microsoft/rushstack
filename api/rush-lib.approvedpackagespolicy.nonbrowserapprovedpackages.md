```

## Remarks

This is part of an optional approval workflow, whose purpose is to review any new dependencies that are introduced (e.g. maybe a legal review is required, or maybe we are trying to minimize bloat). The intent is that the file will be stored in Git and tracked by a branch policy that notifies reviewers when a PR attempts to modify the file.

Example filename: `C:\MyRepo\common\config\rush\browser-approved-packages.json`
