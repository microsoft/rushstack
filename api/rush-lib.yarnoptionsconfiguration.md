## YarnOptionsConfiguration class

Options that are only used when the yarn package manager is selected.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class YarnOptionsConfiguration 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [ignoreEngines](./rush-lib.yarnoptionsconfiguration.ignoreengines.md) |  | <code>boolean</code> | If true, then Rush will add the "--ignore-engines" option when invoking Yarn. This allows "rush install" to succeed if there are dependencies with engines defined in package.json which do not match the current environment.<!-- -->The default value is false. |

## Remarks

It is valid to define these options in rush.json even if the yarn package manager is not being used.

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `YarnOptionsConfiguration` class.
