## PnpmOptionsConfiguration.resolutionStrategy property

The resolution strategy that will be used by PNPM.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly resolutionStrategy: ResolutionStrategy;
```

## Remarks

Configures the strategy used to select versions during installation.

This feature requires PNPM version 3.1 or newer. It corresponds to the `--resolution-strategy` command-line option for PNPM. Possible values are `"fast"` and `"fewer-dependencies"`<!-- -->. PNPM's default is `"fast"`<!-- -->, but this may be incompatible with certain packages, for example the `@types` packages from DefinitelyTyped. Rush's default is `"fewer-dependencies"`<!-- -->, which causes PNPM to avoid installing a newer version if an already installed version can be reused; this is more similar to NPM's algorithm.
