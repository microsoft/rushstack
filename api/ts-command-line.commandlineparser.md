## CommandLineParser class

The "argparse" library is a relatively advanced command-line parser with features such as word-wrapping and intelligible error messages (that are lacking in other similar libraries such as commander, yargs, and nomnom). Unfortunately, its ruby-inspired API is awkward to use. The abstract base classes CommandLineParser and CommandLineAction provide a wrapper for "argparse" that makes defining and consuming arguments quick and simple, and enforces that appropriate documentation is provided for each parameter.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare abstract class CommandLineParser extends CommandLineParameterProvider 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [actions](./ts-command-line.commandlineparser.actions.md) |  | <code>ReadonlyArray&lt;CommandLineAction&gt;</code> | Returns the list of actions that were defined for this CommandLineParser object. |
|  [selectedAction](./ts-command-line.commandlineparser.selectedaction.md) |  | <code>CommandLineAction &#124; undefined</code> | Reports which CommandLineAction was specified on the command line. |
|  [toolDescription](./ts-command-line.commandlineparser.tooldescription.md) |  | <code>string</code> | General documentation that is included in the "--help" main page |
|  [toolFilename](./ts-command-line.commandlineparser.toolfilename.md) |  | <code>string</code> | The name of your tool when invoked from the command line |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [addAction(action)](./ts-command-line.commandlineparser.addaction.md) |  | Defines a new action that can be used with the CommandLineParser instance. |
|  [execute(args)](./ts-command-line.commandlineparser.execute.md) |  | The program entry point will call this method to begin parsing command-line arguments and executing the corresponding action. |
|  [executeWithoutErrorHandling(args)](./ts-command-line.commandlineparser.executewithouterrorhandling.md) |  | This is similar to [CommandLineParser.execute()](./ts-command-line.commandlineparser.execute.md)<!-- -->, except that execution errors simply cause the promise to reject. It is the caller's responsibility to trap |
|  [getAction(actionName)](./ts-command-line.commandlineparser.getaction.md) |  | Retrieves the action with the specified name. If no matching action is found, an exception is thrown. |
|  [onExecute()](./ts-command-line.commandlineparser.onexecute.md) |  | This hook allows the subclass to perform additional operations before or after the chosen action is executed. |
|  [tryGetAction(actionName)](./ts-command-line.commandlineparser.trygetaction.md) |  | Retrieves the action with the specified name. If no matching action is found, undefined is returned. |
