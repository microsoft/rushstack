## RushConfigurationProject.cyclicDependencyProjects property

A list of local projects that appear as devDependencies for this project, but cannot be locally linked because it would create a cyclic dependency; instead, the last published version will be installed in the Common folder.

These are package names that would be found by RushConfiguration.getProjectByName().

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly cyclicDependencyProjects: Set<string>;
```
