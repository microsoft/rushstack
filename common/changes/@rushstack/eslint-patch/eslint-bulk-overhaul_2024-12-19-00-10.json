This will require recalculating the bulk suppressions file.\nEnsure that lint problems suppressed by eslint-bulk-suppressions are available in the `getSuppressedMessages()` function on the linter.\nSimplify patching of eslint by leveraging the `getLinterInternalSlots` unit test helper and walking the AST to get the node.\nOnly compute bulk suppressions information for lint problems that are not already suppressed inline.",
