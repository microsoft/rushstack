      "comment": "Include a `printApiReportDiff` option in the `config/api-extractor-task.json` config file that, when set to `\"production\"` (and the `--production` flag is specified) or `\"always\"`, causes a diff of the API report (*.api.md) to be printed if the report is changed. This is useful for diagnosing issues that only show up in CI.",
