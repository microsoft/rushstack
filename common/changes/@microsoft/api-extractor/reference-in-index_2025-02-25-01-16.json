      "comment": "Include triple-slash references marked with `preserve=\"true\"` from files that only contain re-exports. There was a behavior change in TypeScript 5.5, where only triple-slash references that are explicitly marked with `preserve=\"true\"` are emitted into declaration files. This change adds support for placing these references in files that only contain re-exports, like the API entrypoint file.",
